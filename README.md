# nss-sum-of-multiples
JavaScript functionn to get sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 for all integers below 1000.

1. find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000
2. iterate through integers 1 through 999
3. on each integer, divide it by 3 and check for modulus of zero
    if modulus is zero, add the integer value to
    the running sum variable for three

4. on each integer, divide it by 5 and check modulus
    if modulus is zero, add the integer value to
    the running sum variable for five
                    
5. add the running sum variables of three and five together
    and console.log that total
